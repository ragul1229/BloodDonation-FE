1818 James Blundell performs the first successful blood transfusion of human blood to treat
postpartum hemorrhage.
1840 The first whole blood transfusion to treat hemophilia is successfully completed.
1932 The first blood bank is established at Leningrad hospital.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The first blood transfusion dates back to 16th century where a british physician RICHARD
LOWER kept a dog alive in 1665 when he accidentally bled it to almost death and then revived 
the animal by tranfusing blood from another dog via a tied artery.

The first human blood transfusion was done by JAMES BLUNDELL in 1818 to treat
postpartum hemorrhage and was successfully executed in 1840 to treat hemophilia.

In 1932 the first blood bank was established and they became famous in 1941 when CHARLES
RICHARD DREW's research in the field of blood transfusions, improved techniques for blood
transfusion.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------->HISTORY
Charles Richard Drew (June 3, 1904 – April 1, 1950) was an American surgeon and medical 
researcher. He researched in the field of blood transfusions, developing improved techniques 
for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge to developing large-scale blood banks 
early in World War II. This allowed medics to save thousands of lives of the Allied forces. 
As the most prominent African American in the field, Drew protested against the practice of 
racial segregation in the donation of blood, as it lacked scientific foundation, and resigned 
his position with the American Red Cross, which maintained the policy until 1950.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->WHAT

A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions 
and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation 
of whole blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly
(apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures 
that follow it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->WHY
There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. 
Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever 
and wherever it is needed.
Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can 
save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components. – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used 
individually for patients with specific conditions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->HOW
Blood donations in India are conducted by several organizations and hospitals by organizing blood donation camps. Donors can also 
visit blood banks in hospitals to donate blood or directly to a receiver.
Several Registered Societies like Life Donors Kerala, Be Positive Blood Donation Group, Blood Donors Kerala, etc involve activity 
in blood donation activities around the globe.
National Thalassemia Welfare Society established in 1991 for care and control of Thalassemia is organizing more than 60 camps every year and 
collecting over 4000 units per annum.
Also this website maintains a database of blood donors which facilitates a network between blood donors and the recievers.
